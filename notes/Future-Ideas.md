# Future Ideas

## User Feedback System
- Implement toast notifications or success messages for user actions
- Create a general notification component that can be used throughout the app
- Show clear feedback for different states (loading, success, error)
- Provide helpful error messages for validation failures
- Support different notification types (success, error, warning, info)
- Auto-dismiss notifications after a set time
- Allow manual dismissal of notifications
- Queue multiple notifications if needed
- Position notifications appropriately (top-right, bottom-right, etc.)
